    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Notify-Me" a simple notifier! <!--more--></p>

<p>I was frequently visiting university website for result. I belonged to University of Pune which has no fixed schedule for declaration of result at all. But i was tired of this! Also website doesn't have RSS feed facility. So I decided to write a small app that could periodically extract the webpage, check for changes any made, if yes then it send me a SMS via <a href="http://www.fullonsms.com">FullonSMS</a>. ;)</p>

<p>I didn't want to waste my electricity and bandwidth for this app, so i deployed it on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku.com</a>, and it worked. "notify-me" had given notification at 00:30AM!</p>

<p>This application is at the initial stages. You can fork it from <a href="https://github.com/akash0x53/notify-me">here</a>. Pull requests are most welcome.</p>
